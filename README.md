Advent Of Code Common

This is the repository for my Advent of Code work which can be used over several years.

The challenges can be reviewed at [https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Unlike other repos I produce, this will not use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). It seems pointless to do so. Rather changes will be tracked based on the "Day" of the challenge they come from. Hopefully, by day 25, the code for day 1 will still work.

The "version" numbers in the files indicate the "day" for which the code was built, or last modified, and the year of the challenge, the versions to be 0.20.01, for Day 1 of 2020 challenge. Since the Advent of Code challenges only go back to 2015 and I will likely not live to work on a challenge in 2100, that should cover any years which I work on. Of course being "Advent" the day will always be from 1 to 25 inclusive.
